# Wiroon's Project Portfolio

Hello! Welcome to my project portfortlio

## [Red Wine Project(Python)](https://github.com/WiroonB/RedWine-Project)
### Overview
> Given data of red wine which contains differrent chemical measurements of wine.
Can we predict whether a wine is a good or bad wine? 
I implemented two diffrent algorithms, which are Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier to model and fit the data. In addition, I also optimized models with Hyper-parameter using GridSearch and class weighting. To quantify the models, I used the metrics of model accuracy, model classification report (F1 Score, Precision, Accuracy Between Classes, Recall), model confusion matrix and AUC(Area Under the Curve.) **The best result is Weighted Random Forest with AUC score: 0.76, Accurary score: 92.19%,	and F1 score: 0.81**

## [Don't Get Kicked (Kaggle-R)](https://github.com/WiroonB/DontGetKicked-Kaggle)
**Overview**
> The challenge of this problem is to predict if the car purchased at the Auction is a Kick (bad buy).
I implemented a logistic regression to model and fit the data. To quantify the models, I calculated accuracy with different cutoff values, F1 Score, Precision, Recall which are a better measure for accuracy of a binary classification problem. I also implemented AUC(Area Under the Curve) to find the cutoff value.
**The result of this model has F1 score: 63.42, AUC Score: 66.44 and 
the best score after submitting challenge is 0.08085.**

## [Sales Analysis(Python)](https://github.com/WiroonB/Sales-Analysis)
**Overview**
> Data analysis project completed using Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc. Differrent tasks are completed as following:
> - **Data Cleaning Process** inlucdes Drop NaN values, Removing rows based on a condition, Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype).
> - **Data Exploration** inlcudes five high level business questions related to the data.

## [Wine Exploratory and Predictive Analysis(R)](https://github.com/WiroonB/Wine-Exploratory-PredictiveAnalysis)
**Overview**
>Data science project completed using R as part of school project. The dataset contains more than 6000 different wines, including both red and white wines. For those interested in wine and particularly wine consumption, this project will help wine aficionados make informed decisions when choosing wine and help understand factors that help explain qualitative wine levels. 
>**Exploratory Analysis** focuses on breif description about the topic, data source as well as variables with descriptive statistics of dataset. 
>**Predictive Analysis** focuses on constructing predictive model which includes model building and model results. **Simple linear regression** is implemented. **Prediction method is based on finding the following variables will best predict quality of wine which are Volatile Acidity, Residual Sugar, Free sulphur dioxide & total sulphur dioxide, Sulphates, Alcohol.**

> These are different tasks that are completed:
> - Total Cases vs Total Deaths shows the likelihood of dying if you contract covid in your country.
> - Total Cases vs Population shows what percentage of population got covid.
> - Countries with Highest Infection Rate compared to Population
> - Countries with Highest Death Count per Population
