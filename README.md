### Background

Hello and  welcome to my Project Portfolio!

My name is Wiroon Bowonthanasan. A little bit about me, I did my undergraduate at Baruch College, The City University of New York where I majored in Finance. During my years at Baruch, I have gained exposure to financial and business industry through internships and trainings which helped to prepare me for life after graduation. After a few years of working full time as accounting assistant at small company, I realized that everything is data-driven. Companies want to be ale to transform availabled data into usable information. So I decided to further my education in a master program in Information Systems at Pace Univeristy. In my graduate studies, I was able to learn data science/analytics which particularly interested me and made me want to switch career into the field.

Now I focus on programing on different types of projects and also cunducting analysis on topics that interest me.
